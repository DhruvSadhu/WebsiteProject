**Share any additional information you would like us to know about you.**

I manage my life like a business. So, as an investor, an entrepreneur, and a CEO, let me assure you that your investment into my corporation will pay substantial returns. That is what this is, an investment. It is not a donation; it is not charity, it is not merely a grant, it is not just a scholarship, it is an investment. Granted, I will not be paying you back in cold hard cash, but you will see a return on the principal in the form of innovative goods and services produced. Youâ€™ll also reap the compounding dividends provided by marginal social benefits and positive externalities that accrue over time. These will not be easy, nor immediate, but in the context of the bigger picture, in the long run, they will be the *best* -- ever. 

Your investment in my company will enable me to cut costs and reinvest resources into equities, experiences, and education. It will not only have a compounding return, but it will also have a compounding effect on my ability to produce. Your investment will expand both my top and bottom lines. It will enable me to work harder, work smarter, learn faster, think bigger, and do better. My greatest strengths are a passionate curiosity that drives me to pursue the life of a lifetime learner; and an ambition that pushes me towards continuously engaging in the process of conscious personal development. These qualities make success not a question of _if_, but _when_. These assets will guarantee the growth and returns promised. If you bestow me with an endowment of any kind, you will see every penny spent wisely and effectively. 

I wish to push humanity forward, but I cannot do it alone. I need help, and at this moment, I need _you_. The opportunity here is extraordinary, but not because of the mathematics behind it. Yes, the numbers will be exemplary, but the real beauty runs deeper. This opportunity is exceptional because you will never forget it. No matter how many applications have come before, you will remember reading this one, you will remember saying yes, and you will look back on that decision as the best you have ever made in your capacity as a scholarship officer. Why? Because I seek a great perhaps. As Friedrich Nietzsche said: I seek to conquer a land which no one has yet possessed, and hardly anyone has ever seen. I am going to make a dent in the universe, and if you bet on me, one day you are going to look back and bask in the glory of the fact that you made it happen.

Your consideration is greatly appreciated.

With gratitude,

Dhruv
