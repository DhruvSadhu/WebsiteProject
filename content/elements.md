### Robinhood

**Investor**                         




‘RobinHood' is an investment app that allows users to participate in the stock market without paying direct comissiosn on their orders. For me, RobinHood is simply a medium to execute investment decisions. In my view, a person is probably not investing intelligently if their investment platform is significantly influencing their analysis. I am an investor, not a trader, nor a speculator. Thus, the medium I use to make my investments makes little difference. With that being said, there are two aspects of my experience with RobinHood that I'd like to draw your attention to.

The first concerns their referral program. RobinHood offers users one free stock for every unique user they refer to the app. Over the last 14 months, I’ve referred somewhere between 70-80 individuals to join the app. Hopefully that goes to show you I can be quite driven.

Secondly, I'd like to provide some insight into my investment record. Since beginning in May of 2019 (when I turned 18), I've taken a principal amount of ~$12,500 and turned it into ~$106,000 thus far. Admittedly, that rate of return is completely unsustainable, but I believe I might have a knack for understanding value.

Founding, maintaining, and growing an organization like this comes with a plethora of responsibility.

While some work attributed to my name has been unique, a majority of these duties have been shared among the six founders.
