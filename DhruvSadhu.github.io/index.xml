      <description>Robinhood Investor
â€˜RobinHood&amp;rsquo; is an investment app that allows users to participate in the stock market without paying direct comissiosn on their orders. For me, RobinHood is simply a medium to execute investment decisions. In my view, a person is probably not investing intelligently if their investment platform is significantly influencing their analysis. I am an investor, not a trader, nor a speculator. Thus, the medium I use to make my investments makes little difference.</description>

      <description>Share any additional information you would like us to know about you.
I manage my life like a business. So, as an investor, an entrepreneur, and a CEO, let me assure you that your investment into my corporation will pay substantial returns. That is what this is, an investment. It is not a donation; it is not charity, it is not merely a grant, it is not just a scholarship, it is an investment.</description>
